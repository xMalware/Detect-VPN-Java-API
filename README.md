# Detect VPN Java API

You will find here two Java files that allow you to check if an IP address is a VPN / Proxy or a bad IP from a host for example. Thus, you can check this and retrieve information / details about an IP address from IPWarner's IP lookup technology.

The system is quite accurate and easily usable, the example here is in Java, but you can implement it in any programming language that supports API requests. A free version of the API is available on IPWarner.  It is quite accurate and allows 1,000 requests per day, which is enough for tests. Paid offers are available to detect VPNs, so you can secure your company or business (game server, online store) from fraudsters or bots from this API. 

# Java Proxy Detect

This API also allows you to retrieve IP address details: ASN (Autonoumous System Name), ISP (Internet Service Provider), country name, city name, longitude and latitude, details on the position of the IP address, host name, response time, who owns the IP address, whether the address is malicious, whether the IP address is a shared address on a VPS or a dedicated server and many other features are available from this API. 
This is easy to implement and I invite you to set up a cache over the requests in order to avoid being limited quickly and to recover the data more quickly to process them in real time with your website or application.

Java code uses HTTP Url Java Collection technology that must be work on your server or if you have any SSL handshake issues, you have to update your ca certificates on your server. This will allow you to make quick queries on the API so that you can use the system efficiently and without problems.

## Why this Detector API ?

I chose this API because it is the most powerful VPN detector on the market, and many companies use it. Unfortunately, it is not well enough known on the Internet, and I invite you to try it. Support is fast and offers are really cheap, with unbeatable quality.

# API Performances

The performance is quite good, especially if your server is in Europe or North America. The API is hosted on two continents and with AnyCast technology, when you make a request, the nearest place where the API is hosted is selected. Thus, with tests on an OVH server and a stress test of 1,000 requests per second on several threads, I am at an average of 2 milliseconds per request. I find this particularly powerful, because with other similar API services that have been around longer, responses are not secured by SSL and it takes more than 100 ms, which is not conceivable when you have many requests.

I can't judge the complete system but in any case I've never had a problem with it, since I use it on many websites (including one with 1 million visitors per month) and I've never had a problem with this VPN detector / Proxy / Bad Hosting detector.
